Investigation and Demo

We are using the Geekbench 3 app for measuring ours scheduler performance.
We have found
With equal CPU in foreground and background : 1034 for smp
With 3 CPUs in foreground and 1 in background: 1180 for smp
With 1 CPU in foreground and 3 in background: 616 with smp exactly the same as
single core.

Our results show that giving more CPUs to a task does not guarantee that it will
run 3 times faster. This is due to the fact that the 3rd CPU is not Cache hot
and it needs to some cache exchanges. We also mention that when we run our
foreground to only one bounded CPU we get (for our results) the exact same
value as the single core experiment of Geekbench. Also we have tried to 
send geekbench to background and back to see how this will transfer the
load to the rest of the CPUs. Our result from this cannot be representative as
the load was not distributing equally so the results depending on how much more
time we leave it on the group with more cores.

In general our scheduler is not as good the default fair one. This can be seen
even in boot time of our tablet. Our scheduler it can help when we have a 
cpu intensive app and we want to run it in more queues than the fair does.
